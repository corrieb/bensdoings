# This script is designed to simplify vic-machine usage, but using a single JSON manifest as input to all commands
# The expected layout is that a particular vic-machine configuration will be in a subdirectory of the current dir
# In that subdirectory should be a config.json file which conforms to the format in example.json 
# That subdirectory is then both the input and working directory of vic-machine
# As such, generated certificates and log files will be written to that sub directory as root user
# Note that if you don't specify an admin password in the JSON, you will be prompted each time - this is why the script needs -it
